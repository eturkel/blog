On the last Sunday in February, ODD held an ideation session at the Horn program on the University of Delaware campus in Newark. 
About 40 people showed up to brainstorm ideas for the 2018 open data challenge. The mission for this year’s open data challenge is to make 
Delaware the most accessible state in the country. Accessibility is a broad term. It could relate to ensuring that disabled 
residents are able to fully participate in society. It could also relate to ensuring that all socio-economic and demographic 
groups have the opportunity to fully participate in society. The grand prize for winning the ideation challenge is $20,000 with several 
smaller prizes. TechImpact is the financial sponsor for the event. Representatives from DENREC, DelDOT, and the Delaware Information Center
are sponsoring the event and were on hand to introduce themselves to participants

Ryan and David kicked off the event. Zach Jones and Matt Criscuolo, University of Delaware undergraduates from the Horn Program, 
led the session. Participants introduced themselves and worked through team building activities. Then the groups brainstormed solutions 
to the question, “How might we increase access to outdoor and natural environments for all of Delaware?” As the session went on groups took
broad ideas and formed them into workable concepts to make Delaware more accessible.

At the end of the session, teams shared their ideas with the entire group. Ideas included all in one apps that provide park maps, 
events, and transit information; service kiosk provides access to first aide kits and park maps; Social media data flows in order to 
collect information on parks and turn that data into dashboard data for park managers; equipment library.

The Open Data Challenge opens with a Data Jam on April 2 and closes on May 7.
At upcoming Open Data Challenge events participants have more opportunities to develop their ideas. Next up is a mapping event on Thursday,
March 1.
